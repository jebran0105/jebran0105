## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a freshman at Purdue University majoring in Data Science, interested in exploring the amalgamation of applied economics, data science & analytics. My goals revolve around accelerating businesses through data-driven decisions and identifying high-growth opportunities by analyzing relationships between seemingly unrelated circumstances and events through leveraging data.

Currently working toward building up my skills in Data Science and Analytics through projects related to machine learning, time series analysis, web scraping and the leveraging of advanced AI APIs to develop smart and interesting tools. Check out my projects below!


## 1. Textvert

Textvert is a streamlit-based platform coded in Python that 
allows users to upload video, audio and YouTube links for 
transcription.It is also capable of summarizing 
text input, PDFs and Websites.

**Tools Used:** Python, Streamlit, Pandas, Beautiful Soup, 
Huggingface Transformers, AssemblyAI API

## 2. Customer Churn Prediction

This project uses the IBM Cognos Analytics Customer Churn 
Dataset available on Kaggle. Through this project I've
endeavoured to predict whether or not a customer of a Telco
company would Churn based on more than 15 features.

**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib,
KNN, Logistic Regression, SVC, Random Forest Classifier, 
Gradient Boosting Classifier

## 3. 2021 Stack Overflow Survey Salary Prediction

This project uses the 2021 Stack Overflow Deveeloper Survey 
available on Stack Overflow to predict salary based on factors
such as age, gender, education and so on.

**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib,
Seaborn, KNN, Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, 
Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Classifier, GridSearchCV

## 4. Loan Approval Prediction

This dataset is from 'Dream Housing Finance'. The company deals with home loans across various segments including urban, semi urban and rural areas. The company would like to automate their loan approval process by checking their eligibility with customer details provided through an application form. Some of these details are: Gender, Marital Status, Education, Dependants, and so on.

This project aims to predict whether or not a loan would be approved.

**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib,
Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Claassifier, 
Extra Trees Classifier

## 5. Web Scraping Mini Projects

#### Indeed Data Scraping
Scraped data such as job titles, companies, date posted, salaries and
other data based on a search for a particular job in the form of
an easily readable CSV file.

#### NFL Standings Table Scraping
This script is capable of scraping table data from any website
with minimal knowledge of CSS. For this paarticular one we Used
NFL Standings. Saves to a CSV File.

#### Real Estate Data Scraping
This script scrapes data from a European Real Estate website. 
Data scraped includes Location, Price, Bedrooms and so on. Saves
to a CSV file.

**Tools Used:** Python, Requests, Beautiful Soup, CSS

## 6. Used Car Price Prediction

This dataset is from Kaggle and provides data regarding Used
cars such as model, age, brand and manufacturing year. Through
this project, we attempt to predict the price of a used car
based on its features.

**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib,
Linear Regression

## 7. Credit Card Fraud Detection

In this project we use a 2013 European Credit Card fraud dataset
from Kaggle. We have been provided with various features that
are unknown to protect confidentiality and the 'Class' column represents
whether a transaction is fraudulent or not. We attempt to use
this data to classify which transactions are fraudulent.

**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib,
Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier

## 8. Stock Forecasting

In this project we are attempting to forecast stock price of Some
of the top Indian companies by market capitalization. To do so, 
we are using Meta's open source time series forecasting tool: Prophet.

**Tools Used:** Python, Meta Prophet, Yahoo Finance

## 9. Customer Lifetime Value Prediction

Customer lifetime value (CLV) is an important metric for almost all
customer experience programs. Through this project, we have used
a retail dataset from Kaggle to calculate Customer Lifetime
Values. We then classify customers into 4 groups based on their CLV:
Champions, Loyal Customers, Hibernating, Need Attention.

**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, BG/NBD Model, Gamma-Gamma Model

## 10. Time Series Forecast

In this project we attempt to forecast Bitcoin (BTC) prices using 
ARMA, ARIMA and SARIMA models.

**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Statsmodels
